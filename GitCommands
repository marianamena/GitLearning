1.create repository :

git init repositoryname

2. git config :

git config --global user.name "maryam"
git config --global user.email "mariana88.tw@gmail.com"
git config --global core.editor "/usr/bin/vim"

to see all config of git:
git config --list
also you can see in cat  ~/.gitconfig

3.git add :
git add filename : this file will be tracked by git. this file is added to staging area.

4.git status:
you can see the status of files in git with : git status
with this command ,at the first line ,we can see which branch we are in .
with git status -s : you can see the state of files which are not added to staged area.
?? means : the file is not in staged area,when it is added to stage area A will add at the start of the file.

example: mkdir src ,git add src,when we write git status ,the directory is not in staging area,becuase git dont care about empty directory.

5. git rm :
 git rm filename

6. when you edit a file and then run git status:
you need to run : git add filename again after changing the file.

7. git commmit:

when we write the git commit : it will list all files needed to be commit.(which are in staged area)
this is th vim file ,you can write the comment then save and exit ,all files will be commites.

git commit -a -m "all files are ok to be commited"

8. git ignore file:
mkdir build
touch .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m ".gitignore file is added"

after this, when we add file in .gitignore,nothing will be track:
echo "build/*" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "new directory is added to .gitignore file "
